## Trident animation library

Trident animation library was developed by [Kirill Grouchnikov](https://www.pushing-pixels.org/about-kirill).

- The original library is now part of Radiance. 
- The [github repo](https://github.com/kirill-grouchnikov/trident) has been archived in 2018 and [deleted](https://github.com/kirill-grouchnikov/trident/commit/f2786dbe196297ce9791d16ef57509839b67b59c)
- This is a salvage of original code and docu starting with v1.3
- See the [documentation](https://github.com/homebeaver/trident/wiki)

The goal of this project is to rebuild the lib with mavan and publish it to OSSRH [maven repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.github.homebeaver/trident).
