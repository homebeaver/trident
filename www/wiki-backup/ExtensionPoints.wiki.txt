== Core functionality ==
The core functionality of the Trident library can be extended to address custom needs of the specific applications. Out of the box Trident supports:

* The timeline pulses being fired by a dedicated thread that wakes up every 40ms and updates all the timelines
* Interpolating [[TimelineInterpolatingFields|float and integer fields]] of any Java object that provides the matching public setter methods.
* Swing and SWT [[UIToolkitSupport|UI toolkits]], respecting the threading rules and providing interpolators for the custom graphic classes

Interested applications can use Trident plugins and Trident configuration APIs to:

* Provide a custom pulse source to drive the timeline updates
* Provide additional property interpolators for custom application classes
* Support additional Java-based UI toolkits

== Configuration APIs ==

The <code>org.pushingpixels.trident.TridentConfig</code> class contains the published configuration APIs. The <code>TridentConfig.getInstance()</code> API retrieves an instance of this class which can then be used for:

* Setting a custom [[CustomPulseSource|pulse source]]
* Adding, removing and querying [[CustomPropertyInterpolators|property interpolators]]
* Adding, removing and querying [[CustomUIToolkitHandlers|UI toolkit handlers]]

== Plugins ==

A Trident plugin is specified by the <code>META-INF/trident-plugin.properties</code> file that should be placed in the runtime classpath. Note that you can have multiple plugins in the same runtime environment - if each one is coming from a different classpath jar, for example. 

The format of <code>trident-plugin.properties</code> is simple. Each line in this file should be of the following format:
<pre>
Key=FullyQualifiedClassName
</pre>

There supported keys are:

* '''PropertyInterpolatorSource''' allows specifying [[CustomPropertyInterpolators|custom property interpolators]]
* '''UIToolkitHandler''' allows supporting [[CustomUIToolkitHandlers|custom UI toolkits]]

The core Trident library contains a plugin that supports Swing and SWT UI toolkits, as well as property interpolators for a few core classes. The plugin descriptor is <code>META-INF/trident-plugin.properties</code> in the <code>trident.jar</code>
